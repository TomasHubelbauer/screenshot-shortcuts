### PowerPoint

PowerPoint has a screen recording functionality built-in. You always have to
start up PowerPoint and create a new blank presentation for it to work. Go to
the Insert ribbon tab and select Screen Recording. From there either use the UI
or these keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>Win+Shift+A</kbd>: select screen area recording
- <kbd>Win+Shift+F</kbd>: select full screen recording
- <kbd>Win+Shift+U</kbd>: do not record sound
- <kbd>Win+Shift+O</kbd>: do not record cursor
- <kbd>Win+Shift+R</kbd>: start/pause/resume recording
- <kbd>Win+Shift+Q</kbd>: stop recording

The recording UI will hide unless pinned, to make it show, move the mouse cursor
to 0, 0.

After finishing the recording, it will get inserted into the current slide. To
save the media file alone, right-click on it and select Save Media As.

### Cropping

Use the Snip & Sketch for rectangular, free-form, window or full-screen snip. Or
use Microsoft Paint / [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net).

### Notes

The Snip & Sketch tool can be configured to start instead of the default
<kbd>PrtScn</kbd> behavior.
